# Chapter 4

## THE ALIGN-ITEMS PROPERTY

Earlier in this book, we learned that a flex-container has two axes :
* main axis 
* cross axis

We've also seen that the justify-content property controls how the flex-items are distributed along the main axis.

In this chapter, we'll look at the align-items property, which controls how the flex-items are distributed along the cross-axis.

This chapter will introduce the align-items property and how to use it within a flex-container.  The `align-items` property accepts five possible values.

1. Stretch (default)
2. flex-end
3. flex-start
4. center
5. baseline
